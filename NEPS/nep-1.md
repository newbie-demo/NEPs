## Summary:

In order to ensure the scarcity and reasonable liquidity of Newton tokens (NEW), based on the ideas and opinions of all parties, the following suggestions are put forth to modify the token release rules.

## Details:

The plan for Newton Foundation reserved token release as stated in the Newton White Paper V0.5 is that “1/2 of the total is immediately unlocked, while the rest will be unlocked 1/12 every month.” Through this NEP, it will be changed to “1/5 of the total is immediately released, while the rest will be unlocked 1/36 every month,” and published in the Newton White Paper V0.6.
